## My Peloton Journey

I'm from Chennai, India and during the lockdown I started running on a treadmill. Back in India I didn't follow any trainer, I never signed up for paid workout apps. I just decided to run with what little reading I did on the internet. I could see no improvement in my pace and I realized that I needed some guidance.

I moved to the United States mid-2021, and by early 2022 I signed up to be a part of the Peloton Family! The Peloton App on my phone was my biggest motivator (other than one of my best friends). I instantly fell in love with the workouts, the music and the words of motivation kept me going.

I found my go to instructors...

Rebecca Kennedy, Jess King and Callie Gullickson will always be my top 3 choices for anything Peloton!

Eventhough I loved running, I always felt weak. I felt like I had no upper back or lower body strength. I'm what people call "skinny fat" - there was more fat than muscle in my body!

Then I decided to try out strength on Peloton.. and I loved it. I guess running and strength became my routine!

Interval running was my most common running class type because I read somewhere that interval running can maximize the amount of calories burned.. (let's verify that theory shall we?)

With Strength...

I targeted full body and core workouts. I was always concious about my muffin top!

Going back to Instructors...

I love love LOVE Jess Kings runs- she's super motivating with her words and her choice of music!

and.. Rebecca Kennedy is the absolute go to for anything strength!
